<span class='anchor' id='-about-me'></span>

Hi, I am Boya Li, a Master's student at the National Key Laboratory of Communication Anti-jamming, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), under the supervision of Associate Professor [Zhang Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=711SenAAAAAJ). I graduated from the School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Technology and Business University (BTBU) in 2019.


My research interests include:
- Wireless communications
- Semantic-aware Communications
- Task-oriented Communications
- Deep reinforcement learning
- Large Language Models

<p>I am actively seeking a PhD supervisor who is passionate about [your research field]. With a strong background in [your background, e.g., computer science, bioinformatics] and a keen interest in [specific research interests], I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in your group. Please feel free to reach out via email at <a href="mailto:liberty.in.ee@gmail.com">liberty.in.ee@gmail.com</a> to discuss potential opportunities.</p>
